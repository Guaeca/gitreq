# GitReg: Structured Requirement Repository

**Overview:**  
GitReg is a centralized repository for organizing and storing structured engineering requirements that can be used as starting point for new projects. 

**Vision**  
As LLMs and Agent keep evolving, the last piece for us as humans is to describe what are our desires and give to Agents, Robots, machines to develop/produce it for us.  
At Guaeca, we believe that well structured description of our desire (product, service, material) best will be the output of the automatic agentic/robotic workflow, and the best format known is following mission critical engineering style of writing requirements, like ISO, EARS and in natural language; not model based.

**Purpose:**  
- Provide a structured repository of product/project requirements to serve as starting points for new projects.
- Support multi-agent testing by providing structured requirements as initial datasets.
- Increase visibility and usage of GReq for updating and managing requirements effectively. 
- Establish a community hub for discussing and evolving structured requirements.  
- Educate users on the benefits and application of structured requirements to improve project outcomes.  

**Structure:**  
- `requirements/`: Organized by project 
- `templates/`: Standardized templates for structured requirements in CSV/JSON/Markdown formats.  
- `community/`: Discussion threads, proposals, and community-contributed requirements.

**Why GitReg?**  
- **Centralized Repository:** A single source of truth for all structured requirements.  
- **Scalable Structure:** Expandable to multiple projects, data formats, and agent datasets.  
- **Version control:** Version control ensures all changes are tracked and accessible.  
- **Community-Driven:** Encourages community participation in refining and evolving structured requirements.

**Why Greq?**  
- **Free:** Greq is a free tool (basic plan) to enable requirements elicitation, analysis and improvements.
- **Engineering Quality:** Greq(enterprise plan) is used by companies in the mission critical domain like Automotive, Aerospatial, and more.  

**Future Directions:**  
- Integrate with GReq for direct data import and export.  

**Get Started:**  
1. Explore the `requirements` folder to search for projects/product/service/material requirements.  
2. Explore the `templates` folder to understand the files structure.  
3. Clone the repository if you wanna a local copy of it =)
4. Submit contributions or feedback through the `community` folder.
