    <br>


_A centralized repository for organizing and storing structured engineering requirements <br> that can be used as starting points for new projects._

## **🌐 Vision**  
As LLMs and Agents keep evolving, the last piece for us as humans is to clearly describe our desires 
and provide them to Agents, Robots, and Machines to develop or produce for us.

At Guaeca, we believe that well-structured descriptions of our desires (product, service, material) 
will be the output of the automatic agentic/robotic workflow,
and the best format known follows mission-critical engineering styles like ISO, EARS

**All in natural language, not model-based.**
<br>
## **🎯 Purpose:**  
- Provide a structured repository of product/project requirements to serve as starting points for new projects.  
- Support multi-agent testing by providing structured requirements as initial datasets.  
- Increase visibility and usage of [GReq](https://greq.guaeca.com) for updating and managing requirements effectively.  
- Establish a community hub for discussing and evolving structured requirements.  
- Educate users on the benefits and application of structured requirements to improve project outcomes.  
<br>
## **📂 Structure:**  
- `requirements/`: Organized by project.  
- `templates/`: Standardized templates for structured requirements in CSV/JSON/Markdown formats.  
- `community/`: Discussion threads, proposals, and community-contributed requirements.
<br>
## **✅ Why GitReg?**  
- **Centralized Repository:** A single source of truth for all structured requirements.  
- **Scalable Structure:** Expandable to multiple projects, data formats, and agent datasets.  
- **Version control:** Ensures all changes are tracked and accessible.  
- **Community-Driven:** Encourages community participation in refining and evolving structured requirements.
<br>
## **💥 Why GReq?**  
- **Free:** GReq is a free tool (basic plan) for requirements elicitation, analysis, and improvements.  
- **Engineering Quality:** GReq (enterprise plan) is already in use by companies in mission-critical domains like Automotive, Aerospatial, and more.  
<br>
## **🔮 Future Directions:**  
-  Integrate with GReq for direct data import and export.

** Get Started:**  
1. [Explore the `requirements` folder](#) to search for project/product/service/material requirements.  
2. [Check out the `templates` folder](#) to understand the file structure.  
3. Clone the repository if you want a local copy of it.  
4. Submit contributions or feedback through the `community` folder.
